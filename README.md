System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

  These projects involved working with a fictional company called DriverPass and its owner Liam. By means of an interview transcript, Liam relayed his requests for an application that would enable his company to better facilitate the education of student drivers with the hope of increasing DMV driver’s test pass rates. The application was to serve as an essential tool in the tracking and managing of student driver info including their scheduled driving lessons with appointed drivers and vehicles, progress tracking for written practice tests available for the students, the option to purchase or upgrade driving lesson packages, and the ability for staff to aid students in scheduling and ensure security for all users.


What did you do particularly well? 

  In the business requirements document, I feel as though my section on system components and design was done well. While it may still be a high-level view of the system, I believe I had included enough details to create a clear vision of what the project would entail.

  For the system design document, I liked how my activity diagram for creating a new account, and my DriverPass class diagram came out. I like how I was able to organize their layouts keeping them informative and easy to read. The class diagram was especially difficult to lay out due to the relationships between some of the classes and the roles each class played in the overall system. The result, however, was a logical and hierarchical layout that relays necessary information, as well as infers additional information based on the location of each class relative to the others.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

  The more I worked with draw.io and LucidChart, the more my skills improved. Because of this, my earlier diagrams don’t have the same level of quality that my later ones do. The use case diagram included in the system design document is the earliest example seen in this project and is the likeliest candidate for revision, were I to revisit this project in the future. After that, I would have another look at the requirements section of the business requirements document. Some of the subsections there required information that existed in the gaps of my knowledge and I would have benefited from greater familiarity with some of the included bullet points, if only in the realm of completeness or coherence.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

  The users are the cornerstone of the entire project. Without them, why would the system need to exist in the first place? This project relied heavily on an included transcript of an interview with the client aiming to ascertain the vision of the final product. During the interview the client described different functionalities the system should have, use cases afforded to different users, and how users should be able to interact with the system. This interview proved invaluable throughout this project. The goal is to develop a system that meets their needs, not the needs of the developers.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  In the past I have always had a head-on approach to software design. I had a tendency to dive straight into writing code, tackling problems as they came up. This never proved to be very effective and usually resulted in dropping the project altogether. These exercises have taught me the importance of planning a project in advance so as to make the development process more fluid and efficient. UML class and activity diagrams seem like they would be especially useful in software development, with their ability to describe aspects of a system in a way that reflects how the software might be written.
